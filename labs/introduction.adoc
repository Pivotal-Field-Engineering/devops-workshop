= Labs

Welcome to the lab! Here you will find a collection of exercises and accompanying source-code.

== Overview

This workshop contains a number of lab folders meant to be worked through in numerical order - as each exercise builds upon the last. The only exception to this sequence is the *00* folder. This folder references sample applications in *samples*.  These applications can be pushed to Cloud Foundry at any time.

Your workspace is the *my_work* folder. If you get stuck implementing any of the labs, *solutions* are available for your perusal.
